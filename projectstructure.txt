Summary

This structure supports:

Real-time streaming ML pipelines

Modular Google Cloud integrations

Reproducible evaluation and benchmarking

Production-ready deployment and monitoring

Clear separation between ML, backend, and frontend

It mirrors how a real Google Cloud or public-sector ML system would be organized, while remaining feasible for an academic MLOps project.
